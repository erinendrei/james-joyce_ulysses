			<p>(<i>The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled tramsiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o’-the wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti’s halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.</i>)</p>

			<p>(<i>They release him. He jerks on. A pigmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbishtip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a <span title="[sic] 'scrofulous'">scrufulous</span> child. Cissy Caffrey’s voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.</i>)</p>

				<span>Edy Boardman</span>

			<p>(<i>Bickering.</i>) And says the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That’s not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver, and lancecorporal Oliphant.</p>

				<span>Stephen</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Triumphaliter.</i>) <i>Salvi facti i sunt.</i></p>
			<p>(<i>He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scares it with a kick.</i>)</p>

				<span>Lynch</span>

			<p>So that?</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stephen</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Looks behind.</i>) So that gesture, not music not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lynch</span>
			</p>
			<p>Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stephen</span>

			<p>We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.</p>

			</p>
			<p>Ba!</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stephen</span>
			</p>
			<p>Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug! This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lynch</span>
			</p>
			<p>Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stephen</span>
			</p>
			<p>Lecherous lynx, to <i>la belle dame sans merci,</i> Georgina Johnson, <i>ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.</i></p>
			<p>(<i>Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lynch</span>
			</p>
			<p>Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.</p>
			<p>(<i>They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.</i></p>
			<p>
				<i>Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillen’s hairdresser’s window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson’s image. A concave mirror</i>
				<i>at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level, Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the convex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.</i>
			</p>
			<p><i>At Antonio Rabaiotti’s door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!</p>
			<p>(<i>He disappears into Olhousen’s, the pork butcher’s, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter, puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig’s crubeen, the other a cold sheep’s trotter, sprinkled with wholepepper. He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>Stitch in my side. Why did I run?</p>
			<p>(<i>He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.</p>
			<p>(<i>He stands at Cormack’s corner, watching.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p><i>Aurora borealis</i> or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar’s bush. We’re safe. (<i>He hums cheerfully.</i>) London’s burning, London’s burning! On fire, on fire! (<i>He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.</i>) I’ll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.</p>
			<p>(<i>He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Urchins</span>
			</p>
			<p>Mind out, mister!</p>
			<p>(<i>Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns <span title="[sic] 'aswing'">awsing</span>, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.</i>)</p>

			<p>Haltyaltyaltyall.</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Halts erect stung by a spasm.</i>) Ow.</p>
			<p>(<i>He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Gong</span>
			</p>
			<p>Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.</p>
			<p>(<i>The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman’s whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Motorman</span>
			</p>
			<p>Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.</i>)</p>
			<p>No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow’s exerciser again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (<i>He feels his trouser pocket.</i>) Poor mamma’s panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day, the wheel of the black Maria, peeled off my shoe at Leonard’s corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all he same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (<i>He closes his eyes an instant.</i>) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!</p>
			<p>(<i>A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O’Beirne’s wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.</i>)</p>

				<span>The Figure</span>

			<p>(<i>Impassive, raises a signal arm.</i>) Password. <i>Sraid Mabbot.</i></p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>Haha. <i>Merci</i>. Esperanto. <i>Slan leath</i>. (<i>He mutters.</i>) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.</p>
			<p>(<i>He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.</i>)</p>

			<p>(<i>He swerves, sidles, stepaside, slips past and on.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the <i>Irish Cyclist</i> the letter headed, <i>In darkset Stepaside</i>. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.</p>
			<p>(<i>Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>O.</p>
			<p>(<i>Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepoke, sweets of sin, potato soap.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.</p>
			<p>(<i>The retriever approches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes.

Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal in especial with atavism.

If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler’s weak chest.

Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be <i>virgo intacta.</i></p>

			<p>(<i>Reads a bill of health.</i>) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer’s peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.</p>

A man in purple shirt and grey trousers brownsocked, passes with an ape’s gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantlepiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.</i>)</p>

With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a gorget of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief, tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter.

				<span class="smallcaps">first watch</span>

			<p>(<i>Taking out his notebook.</i>) What’s his name?</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>

			<p>Name and address.</p>
			<p>(<i>Corny Kelleher, weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Quickly.</i>) O, the very man! (<i>He whispers.</i>) Simon Dedalus’ son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">second watch</span>
			</p>
			<p>Night, Mr. Kelleher.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>To the watch, with drawling eye.</i>) That’s all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (<i>He laughs.</i>) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">first watch</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Turns to the crowd.</i>) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.</p>
			<p>(<i>The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>
			</p>
			<p>Leave it to me, sergeant. That’ll be all right. (<i>He laughs, shaking his head.</i>) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">first watch</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Laughs.</i>) I suppose so.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Nudges the second watch.</i>) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (<i>He lilts, wagging his head.</i>) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">second watch</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Genially.</i>) Ah, sure we were too.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>

			<p>(<i>Winking.</i>) Boys will be boys. I’ve a car round there.</p>

				<span class="smallcaps">second watch</span>
			</p>
			<p>All right, Mr. Kelleher. Good night.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>
			</p>
			<p>I’ll see to that.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.</i>) Thank you very much, gentlemen, thank you. (<i>He mumbles confidentially.</i>) We don’t want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">first watch</span>
			</p>
			<p>O, I understand, sir.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">second watch</span>

			<p>It was only in case of corporal injuries I’d have had to report it at the station.</p>

			<p>(<i>Nods rapidly.</i>) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.</p>

				<span class="smallcaps">second watch</span>

			<p>It’s our duty.</p>

			<p>Good night, men.</p>

				<span class="smallcaps">the watch</span>

			</p>
			<p>(<i>Blows.</i>) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.</i>) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet’s. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan’s car and down to nighttown.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Laughs.</i>) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (<i>He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.</i>) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Tries to laugh.</i>) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don’t know him (poor fellow he’s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>(<i>The horse neighs.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">the horse</span>
			</p>
			<p>Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>
			</p>
			<p>Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs. Cohen’s and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (<i>He laughs.</i>) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.</p>
			<p>(<i>Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Scratches his nape.</i>) Sandycove! (<i>He bends down and calls to Stephen.</i>) Eh! (<i>He calls again.</i>) Eh! He’s covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn’t lift anything off him.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>
			</p>
			<p>Ah well, he’ll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I’ll shove along. (<i>He laughs.</i>) I’ve a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">the horse</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Neighs.</i>) Hohohohohome.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>Good night. I’ll just wait and take him along in a few⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>(<i>Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">corny kelleher</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>From the car, standing.</i>) Night.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>Night.</p>
			<p>(<i>The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow</i> <i>nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>Eh! Ho! (<i>There is no answer; he bends again.</i>) Mr. Dedalus! (<i>There is no answer.</i>) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (<i>He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.</i>) Stephen! (<i>There is no answer. He calls again.</i>) Stephen!</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">stephen</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Groans.</i>) Who? Black panther vampire. (<i>He sighs and stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.</i>)</p>
			<p>Who⁠ ⁠… drive⁠ ⁠… Fergus now.<br/>
			And pierce⁠ ⁠… wood’s woven shade?⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>(<i>He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (<i>He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen’s waistcoat.</i>) To breathe. (<i>He brushes the woodshavings from Stephen’s clothes with light hands and fingers.</i>) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (<i>He listens.</i>) What!</p>
			<p>
				<span class="smallcaps">stephen</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Murmurs.</i>)</p>
			<p>… shadows⁠ ⁠… the woods.<br/>… white breast⁠ ⁠… dim⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>(<i>He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen’s face and form.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Communes with the night.</i>) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him⁠ ⁠… (<i>He murmurs.</i>)⁠ ⁠… swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts⁠ ⁠… (<i>He murmurs.</i>)⁠ ⁠… in the rough sands of the sea⁠ ⁠… a cabletow’s length from the shore⁠ ⁠… where the tide ebbs⁠ ⁠… and flows⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>(<i>Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.</i>)</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.</i>) Rudy!</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rudy</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<i>Gazes unseeing into Bloom’s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauve face. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot. A white lambskin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.</i>)</p>
